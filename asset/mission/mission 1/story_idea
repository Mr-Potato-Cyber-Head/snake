Mission 1 – The Awakening
Design & Environment Notes

STORY OVERVIEW
Zeta Galaxy.
Planet Xyra-9.
A lifeless surface... until something awakens.

A green, glowing snake—Nova—emerges from stasis beneath crimson cliffs and scattered crystals. He remembers nothing. Only a soft voice in his head:

“Wake up... You are the last survivor.”

The land is unstable. Some crystals pulse with energy, others shimmer ominously in red. Nova must gather energy to stabilize his form before the rising radiation consumes the surface.

ENVIRONMENT SETTING

PLAYER INTERACTION & FEEDBACK
Nova starts weak; speed and glow increase with each green crystal

Touching red crystals dims Nova’s light and slows him briefly

Optional glow effect intensifies as progress is made

At the end, Nova pulses brightly for the first time = mission success
