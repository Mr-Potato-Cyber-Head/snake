Mission 3 – Echoes of the Deep
Design & Environment Notes

STORY OVERVIEW
Nova follows a set of coordinates hidden in the signal decoded from the underground caverns. They lead to a flooded trench on the shadow side of Xyra-9—an area long forgotten and submerged in electrically charged liquid.
The terrain is unstable, covered in glowing currents and veiled in fog. Movement is heavier, the silence is deeper.
Ancient conduits pulse beneath the surface. Nova must reactivate them to unlock a deeper layer of the message—and face memories that were meant to be erased.

ENVIRONMENT SETTING
Location: Submerged alien trench zone

Mood: Mysterious, slow, tense

Theme Colours: Deep blue, electric teal, dim purple, cyan accents

Lighting: Low ambient light with flickering reflections and glowing effects

Sound: Echoes, water hums, deep electrical pulses, muffled movement

VISUAL ELEMENTS
Background walls: Ruined alien structures with moss, glyphs, and embedded cables

Floor: Mixture of dry alien stone and glowing liquid tiles (some stable, some not)

Conduits (Mission Objective): Tall glowing towers or pillars that activate on contact

Hazards:

Collapsing floating tiles

Electrified currents that push the player

Fog zones that reduce visibility

Visual FX:

Water ripple shaders

Glowing fog layers

Particle streams (data/sparks)

PLAYER INTERACTION & FEEDBACK
Snake glows soft green, but light diffuses in fog/water

Glitch effects appear briefly near corrupted energy fields

Movement slightly slower in liquid areas

Fog and water distort audio (optional filter or volume dip)

OBJECTIVE & GAMEPLAY
Goal: Activate all conduits to unlock the central archive gate

Puzzle Elements:

Order-based activation

Navigating invisible paths through fog

Hazards:

Collapsing tiles

Directional push currents

Trap zones hidden under mist

ROOM FLOW & LAYOUT
Three distinct zones, each with unique hazard + conduit

Central gate remains locked until all 3 are activated

Optional branching paths contain lore fragments or visual hints

SOUND & AMBIENCE
Ambient loop: Deep underwater synths, echo pulses

Interaction SFX:

Conduit activation: clean ascending tone + flash

Trap activation: muffled electric buzz

Fog: low white noise / static when entered

Music: Slow, pulsing, rhythmic—builds as conduits are activated

MISSION ENDING
When all conduits are active, the central gate opens. Nova enters the submerged archive, and a distorted voice plays:

“He was never supposed to remember.”

Screen fades to black.
