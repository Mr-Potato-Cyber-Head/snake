Mission 4 – Core Breach
Design & Environment Notes

STORY OVERVIEW
The trail leads Nova deep into the planet’s internal core system—an artificial power facility buried beneath layers of molten infrastructure. This is no natural cave—it’s a forgotten engine. Massive turbines and data conduits still pulse faintly with energy.

But something’s wrong. The core is destabilizing.

Corrupted heat signatures, volatile plasma leaks, and fragments of foreign code swirl through the environment. It’s not just collapsing—it’s trying to wipe everything, including Nova.

The final pieces of memory are near, but time is running out.
Nova must reroute energy from failing core lines before the facility implodes.

ENVIRONMENT SETTING
Location: Collapsing artificial energy core buried beneath Xyra-9

Mood: Urgent, high-stakes, unstable

Theme Colours: Fiery orange, molten red, electric blue (energy lines), dark steel

Lighting: Flickering lights, glowing lava, red alert flashes

Sound: Deep mechanical rumble, venting pressure, glitch pulses, emergency alarms

VISUAL ELEMENTS
Background walls: Reinforced alloy plating, cracked panels, glowing data streams

Floor: Metallic tiles, some melted or fractured; active and broken power lines

Lava hazards: Flowing molten paths (animated); instant death zones

Flickering light panels: Random blinking lights and warning symbols

Plasma Leaks (hazards): Spraying arcs of energy from broken conduits

Power Switches (Objectives): Console terminals Nova must reach to stabilize core

PLAYER INTERACTION & FEEDBACK
Nova flickers rapidly near high-energy zones

Light intensity pulses with system instability

Subtle camera shake to simulate structural failure

Bright red UI indicator for rising heat level or time left

OBJECTIVE & GAMEPLAY
Goal: Reach and activate all core reroute terminals before time runs out

Mechanics:

Timed level with countdown

Navigating lava corridors

Avoiding random plasma bursts

Hazards:

Collapsing walkways

Flash-fire zones (temporarily dangerous)

Glitch traps (temporary loss of control)

ROOM FLOW & LAYOUT
Central core room contains the main gate

Three secondary branches with a reroute terminal each

Completion of all terminals unlocks the main archive door

SOUND & AMBIENCE
Ambience: Alarms, echoing turbine rotations, creaking metal

Hazard SFX:

Lava: bubbling hiss

Plasma: crackling electric whine

Countdown: rhythmic beeps intensifying as time shortens

Music: High-tempo, pulsing synth with emergency tone underlayers

MISSION ENDING
As Nova activates the final terminal, the core begins to stabilize—barely.

A section of the wall slides open, revealing a cryo-pod… empty. A message is etched into the glass:

"S-09: Disconnected."

Suddenly, the light cuts out.
