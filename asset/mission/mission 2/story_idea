Mission 2 – The Signal Below
Design & Environment Notes

STORY OVERVIEW
After collecting the energy crystals on Xyra-9’s surface, Nova follows a strange underground vibration—a signal that repeats in a coded pulse.

He descends into the planet’s crust through a cracked canyon wall, finding himself surrounded by ancient, pulsing stones and unstable red crystal formations.
There’s a signal buried here, repeating... broken... waiting to be rebuilt.

The environment is darker, heavier. Interference grows. Nova’s light dims at times, and static flickers across his vision.
He must find the source of the signal and stabilize it before his system becomes too corrupted to continue.

ENVIRONMENT SETTING
Location: Subterranean crystal caverns beneath the surface of Xyra-9

Mood: Ominous, mysterious, claustrophobic

Theme Colours: Deep reds, purples, dark gray stone, corrupted glows

Lighting: Dim, with flickering red crystal light and static pulses

Sound: Low hum, distant signal beeps, crumbling rock

VISUAL ELEMENTS
Cave Walls: Cracked stone with glowing plasma veins (red-orange)

Floor: Jagged paths with scattered debris, corrupted zones

Corrupted Red Crystals (hazard): Drain Nova’s glow temporarily

Signal Cores (objective): Pulsing orange-red nodes scattered through the cavern

Traps:

Static fields

Collapsing tiles

Looping corridors (optional illusion area)

Environmental FX: Dust particles, digital flicker, red fog

PLAYER INTERACTION & FEEDBACK
Nova’s glow dims near corrupted zones

Movement becomes sluggish or flickery if red crystals are touched

Signal cores must be “stabilized” (e.g., collected and held for 2–3 seconds)

Interference effects increase as Nova nears the signal source

OBJECTIVE & GAMEPLAY
Goal: Collect and stabilize all signal cores in the cave

Hazards:

Red crystals (temporary debuffs)

Collapsing tiles

Static zones (reverse controls / flickering vision)

Puzzle Mechanics:

Navigating narrow winding paths

Timed platform areas

Simple memory-based sequence (optional)

ROOM FLOW & LAYOUT

[Signal Core A] → [Trap Field] → [Signal Core B]
      ↓                   ↑
[Red Crystals]     [Collapse Zone]
      ↓                   ↑
   [Start Area] →→→→ [Signal Core C]
                        ↓
                  [Exit Gate]
The map structure encourages careful navigation and timed execution

Each core unlocks part of the exit gate

SOUND & AMBIENCE
Ambient Sound: Echoing vibrations, static pulses

FX:

Crystal touch = glitch sound

Signal core stabilization = harmonic pulse + screen flash

Music: Minimal, dark synth with rhythmic pulses that grow more intense with each core collected

MISSION ENDING
As Nova stabilizes the final signal core, the ground shakes.
The signal clears briefly.
A distorted log plays:

“Subject S-09... unstable... signal compromised... terminate...”

A hidden tunnel opens beneath him, pulling him downward.
Mission 3 unlocked.
